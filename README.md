### User Stories:

- **User Story #1**: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

- **User Story #2**: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

- **User Story #3**: Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

- **User Story #4**: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

- **User Story #5**: When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

- **User Story #6**: I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

- **User Story #7**: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

- **User Story #8**: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

- **User Story #9**: The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

- **User Story #10**: The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

- **User Story #11**: Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

- **User Story #12**: When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

- **User Story #13**: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

- **User Story #14**: My product landing page should have at least one media query.

- **User Story #15**: My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

### Why?

It had been a long time since I had completed the training and assigned exercises, all that was missing was to complete the scheduled projects to earn the certification.

And what can I say. Sometimes it's interesting to brush up on the basics....
